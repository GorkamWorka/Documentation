## Priority R&D for cloud native tech and DevOps solution.

This is a compiled list of interesting tools and object, coming from CNCF Landscape maps. It is made as a reference desk of interesting technologies and opportunities for cloud tech and infrastructure development.  

Each Section represents a category of software, estimated Value of the section (personnal assesment) given in a 0-5 stars rating.  
Each list is ordinated by software predominance (again personnal assesment) and usability.  
Explaination and selection critera given on case by case basis. 
~ denote priority target (p.a. again)
